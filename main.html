<h2>Masters Thesis</h2>
<h3>Title: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for multiple robots</h3>
<p>Multi-robot SLAM is very important in Co-operative robotics. Multiple robots can explore the environment more robustly and efficiently than a single robot. To work together they need to build a global map using all the local maps. In this paper, we demonstrate that our algorithm works faster than the existing algorithms for the map merging.</p>
